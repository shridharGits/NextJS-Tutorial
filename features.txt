# Tutorial
To create routes
just create a file with route name in 'pages' folder
- suppose to create /news route, create news.js
to create nested routes like news/specific-news
- create news folder and add [newsId].js file to it, [ ] this is identifier in nextjs through which we can create dynamic routes

<Link> Tag is used to prevent reloading of page again and again, a tag reload the page
Link tag is the real essence of react and next;
Link tag loads the required component without fetching new html page
